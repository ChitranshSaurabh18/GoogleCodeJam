# GoogleCodeJam
This project contains solutions to past problems asked in Google Code Jam challenges.

The solutions are arranged in the following folder structure:

	The top level folder name is the year name prefixed with "_" e.g. "_2018" for problems asked in year 2018 
	The second level folder would be the round name e.g. "qualification" for "Qualification Round", "round_1A" for "Round 1A" and so on

The classes are named as per the problem title itself.
